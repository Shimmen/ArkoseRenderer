# Arkose Renderer

TODO: Add some real info here!

Render stuff ...

## Setup

Right now this only officially supports Windows, but it's possible other platforms will work too, or with minimal changes.

 1. Clone this repository into a directory called `Arkose`. There is a stupid reason why that is and I'm going to fix that at some point in time...
 1. Download & install the Vulkan SDK from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
    1. If you want to be able to debug this also download the debug libraries and copy to the Vulkan SDK install location. It should be available on the same page.
 1. Done! All other third-party dependencies are taken care of.
