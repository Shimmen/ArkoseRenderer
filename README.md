Render stuff ...

## Setup

Right now this only officially supports Windows, but it's possible other platforms will work too, or with minimal changes.

 1. Clone this repository
 1. Download & install the Vulkan SDK from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
    1. If you want to be able to debug this also download the debug libraries and copy to the Vulkan SDK install location. It should be available on the same page.
 1. Create project files using CMake & build project. All third-party dependencies (except Vulkan) are taken care of automatically.
