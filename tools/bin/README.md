# Tool binaries

Tool binaries will be built into this directory as needed, but should not be checked in!

A few files are already in this file: `prefs.toml` and `rules.toml` which are used by AssetCooker. **The AssetCooker executable is not yet in here, so needs to be placed manually!** Simply download it, build it, and copy the executable to this directory. I don't want to check it in, and hopefully soon there are GitHub releases of AssetCooker (https://github.com/jlaumon/AssetCooker) so we can automate downloading the executable to right here.
