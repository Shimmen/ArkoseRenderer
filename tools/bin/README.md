# Tool binaries

Tool binaries will be built into this directory as needed, but should not be checked in!

A few files are already in this file: `prefs.toml` and `rules.toml` which are used by AssetCooker. The AssetCooker executable is not checked in, but will automatically be downloaded as needed when you run `RunAssetCooker.bat`.
